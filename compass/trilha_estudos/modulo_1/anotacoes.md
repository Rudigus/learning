[Noções básicas de algoritmo](https://www.devmedia.com.br/nocoes-basicas-de-algoritmo/26405)

I would pay attention to Cormen et al.'s Introduction to Algorithms. There, an algorithm is defined as a sequence of computational steps that takes one or more values (input) and produces one or more values (output) as a result. 

Well, why would you need one? To solve any well-defined problem, like some day-to-day problems and computational problems.

[Boas práticas para um bom README](https://www.alura.com.br/artigos/escrever-bom-readme)

Providing a README is one of the easiest and best ways to explain a project and make it easier to understand,  navigate through and even share to other people. So it is very important. 

The README is generally a plain text file with markup (like Markdown) or just simple text. Those two articles focus on READMEs using Markdown and used for GitHub projects (but applicable to other version control platforms).

The overall structure is not fixed, but there are a lot of good practices available and listed on those articles. In the end, you can just browse some well-known and popular repositories to get some inspiration and write your own. 

Just don't be lazy: if you don't provide a README or you just leave the default GitHub README, most people unfamiliar with the project will feel lost and might look for alternatives. Also, it's good for marketing both yourself (portfolio) and your project, so do it ASAP!
